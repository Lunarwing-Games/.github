# Welcome to Lunarwing Games ‚ú®üåô

A small independent studio based in Canada, crafting works of art through the medium of gaming. \
We develop primarily for PC and distribute through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com). \
At Lunarwing, we believe in *creative freedom*, and our games embody that spirit.

## Current Projects ‚ú®

- **Within Ashes** ‚Äî A roguelike with elements of resource management and real-time survival combat. *(March 2026)*  
- **Eclipse** ‚Äî A grand, lore-rich JRPG that embraces beauty, heart, and high fantasy. *(June 2027)*  

## Creative Philosophy üåå
We believe games can be both **beautiful** and **bold** ‚Äî a space where elegance meets imagination, and artistry meets play.  
Sensuality, absurdity, and sincerity all have their place within our walls and within our hearts.

We also believe in project transparency. That is why the **source code** for all of our games is here on GitHub under a "source available" policy.
