# Welcome to Lunarwing Games ✨🌙

A small independent studio based in Canada, crafting works of art through the medium of gaming. \
We develop primarily for PC and distribute through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com). \
At Lunarwing, we believe in *creative freedom*, and our games embody that spirit.

## Current Projects ✨
> [!NOTE]
> All release dates in parentheses `()` are approximate and subject to change.  
> Titles may also evolve during development.

- **Within Ashes** — A roguelike with elements of resource management and real-time survival combat. *(March 2026)*  
- **Eclipse** — A grand, lore-rich JRPG that embraces beauty, heart, and high fantasy. *(June 2027)*  

## Creative Philosophy 🌌
We believe games can be both **beautiful** and **bold** — a space where elegance meets imagination, and artistry meets play.  
Sensuality, absurdity, and sincerity all have their place within our walls and within our hearts.

## Technology & Tools 🛠️
We build our worlds *differently* in these parts.  
Our core technologies include:
- **LÖVE2D** (Lua, C++)  
- **Pygame-CE** (Python 3.13+)  
- **Raylib** (C++, C#)  
- **OpenGL / GLFW** (C++)
